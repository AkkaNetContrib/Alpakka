Caveat Emptor
-------------

A component in this project does not have to obey the rule of staying binary compatible between releases. Breaking API changes may be introduced without notice as we refine and simplify based on your feedback. A module may be dropped in any release without prior deprecation.

Running the Test Suite
----------------------

As of August 2020, the Alpakka repository structure and projects has been consolidated and modernized into a single solution file which affects how test projects are run. Please check the [test documentation](https://github.com/akkadotnet/Alpakka/blob/dev/docs/Testing.md) for more information.
