#### 1.0.0-beta1 August 21 2020 ####
First published release of Alpakka on NuGet.

All plugins have been modernized to work with [Akka.NET](https://getakka.net/) v1.4.10 and the latest RabbitMQ, Azure, AWS, SignalR, and other drivers.

We've also published our initial documentation website to https://alpakka.getakka.net/

Over the next few weeks we will be adding additional unit tests, documentation cleanup, and bugfixes based on community feedback.

Please give our packages a try and let us know what we can do better!
